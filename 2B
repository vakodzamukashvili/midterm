I have created a file using script:
echo "Elliptic Curves are efficient." > ecc.txt
After, i have signed it using my private key:
openssl dgst -sha256 -sign ecc_private.pem -out ecc.sig ecc.txt
To verify, i have used script:
openssl dgst -sha256 -verify ecc_public.pem -signature ecc.sig ecc.txt
I am uploading the screenshot, ecc.txt and ecc.sig files.
